Research Article and Related Wireless Network Traffic Time Series of an Enterprise Network Dataset

Description: This MATLAB dataset (.mat) contains the collected real measurement data from a total of 470 access points (APs) deployed in the Linnanmaa campus of the University of Oulu, Finland. The measurements include IDs, dates of data collection, number of users, received traffic data, transmitted traffic data and location names of each AP. Each observation of traffic data and number of users provide the data value at every 10-minute interval between December 18, 2018 and February 12, 2019. Please cite this as: S. P.
